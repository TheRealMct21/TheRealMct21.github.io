Been in Unity & Blender for 6 years. I work on avatars (uploads, edits, accessories, PC↔Quest) and I also teach — no stress, no dumb questions. I run a group called Unity for Dummies where I help people learn the basics and beyond. Whether you need your avatar fixed up or want to pick up some skills yourself, I’m happy to help.
