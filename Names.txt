Vampire Infection is a fast-paced automatic vampire tag game.

When you join, you’ll be assigned as either a vampire (red) or a human (green).

Vampires can “infect” humans by getting close, turning them into vampires too.

The match starts automatically once enough players are in and resets when all humans have been infected.

Simple rules, nonstop action — survive as a human or spread the curse as a vampire! 🧛‍♂️👥

🙏 Thanks to everyone who’s joined and made this world so much fun — you’re the reason it’s alive and popular!

Stay tuned — more game modes, features, and surprises are coming soon. Keep playing, keep spreading the infection, and help us make Vampire Infection even crazier and more fun!
